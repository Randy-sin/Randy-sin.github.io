        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 17-year-old AI developer and student researcher focusing on <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong> and <strong>Mathematical Modelling</strong>. 
            My work explores how algorithmic logic and interactive design can support emotional awareness and productivity in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been recognized as a <strong>Distinguished Winner</strong> of the Apple Swift Student Challenge (Global Top 50) and invited to WWDC25.
            Beyond development, I lead research teams in mathematical modelling competitions, translating real-world scenarios into computable frameworks.
